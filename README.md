### Beautiful Aspects of Earth

## Sunset & Landscape Pictures-
1. Griffith Observatory 
- Griffith Park is a well-known tourist attraction located in Los Angeles, California. Here, I was able to take stunning pictures of the sunset and the famous "Hollywood" sign while waiting in line for the Griffith Observatory with my family. These picures were all caputured minutes after each other, and they really capture the hidden beauty of Earth. I recommend that you visit this location not just for the view, but also to learn more about our solar system and see the planets and stars it consists of.

2. On the Road
- While travelling throughout the state of Calfornia, I have enjoyed the feel of looking out the window from my car and seeing many different landscapes. The first picture was taken in 75 mph winds in Patterson. The second picture was taken in the late evening in Downey, and I chose to include this picture because I felt that the palm tree and freeway perfectly bordered and highlighted the Sun's magnificence. The last picture seems a little gloomy with the dark blue sky, yet the Sun brightens it and emphasizes the building just like a painting.


## Nature with Animals-
1. Aquarium of the Pacific
- The Aquarium of the Pacific is located in Long Beach, California, and they are famous for their impressive display of animals. I loved how the jellyfish were able to light up their surroundings in a serene way while still showing off their harmful tentacles. There was also an exhibit where I was able to touch baby stingrays and sharks. This location provided me with a unique experience and was very informative regarding marine life since it teaches about the importance of creatures in water.

2. San Diego Zoo
- The San Diego Zoo is located in San Diego, California. There are many exotic creatures here, but since many of the animals were in locations physically separate from the visitors, it was difficult to get clear pictures of the animals. The animals I have included perfectly posed for the camera, and I was delighted to see and learn from their behaviors. The San Diego Zoo and Safari were both some of my favorite locations to visit, since I was able to learn about animals from all over the world and even learned about some conservation efforts.

## Flowers (At Home & School)-
I really enjoy taking pictures of flowers and watching the flower buds bloom perfectly during the spring season. The butterfly perfectly landed to get some food from some plants (maintained by the Ecology & Wildlife club) at school. These roses in my home garden bloomed in very close proximity to one another, and all of the different colors and shades of pink really made the picture more vibrant.
